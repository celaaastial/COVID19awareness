        <p class="one"> The COVID-19 pandemic has been ongoing for almost two years,
           and although vaccine efforts may be successful, the damage it has left in
           its wake is truly devastating; socio-economically, financially, physically,
           and even mentally. It has taken 4.55 million lives as of October 2021. To
           understand the biological reason behind why the struggle to eliminate the
           virus is critical to eliminating it completely, we cannot prevent the
           collapse of markets, the loss of jobs, and even, unfortunately,
           the rise of sexual abuse due
           to the very strict lockdowns.  </p>
